# vrchat-api

This library wraps the VRChat API.
Functions for each API endpoint, type information for convenient use in TypeScript are provided.

Created for internal use with [VRCFriendCheck](https://github.com/mnao305/VRCFriendCheck). As a result, there are multiple API endpoints that are not implemented in this library.
